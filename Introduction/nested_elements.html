//HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
//The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

/*
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
*/
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>

</body>
</html>
